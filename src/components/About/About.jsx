                        <p>I was born and raised on a small island called Ã…land in Finland, where fishing and sauna are two of the most popular activities. I left the island at 19 and have since lived in five countries across three continents. Discovering new cultures has become a huge interest, and one of my favorite ways of doing so is through food. Cooking is also a way for me to connect with my home whenever I can't go back.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>My studies in ICT at KTH in Stockholm led me to start a career in Software Engineering - a job that I really enjoyed. The job also helped spark my interest in project management, which led me to go back to school for a master's degree in IT Project Management. Now that the program is coming to an end, I'm growing increasingly excited to continute my career. I would be most excited about roles in the intersection between business and technology, but also frontend engineering or mobile development roles.</p>
