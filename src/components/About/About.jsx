                        <p>I was born and raised on a small island called Ã…land in Finland, where fishing and sauna are two of the most popular activities. I left the island at 19 and have since lived in five countries across three continents. Discovering new cultures has become a huge interest, and one of my favorite ways of doing so is through food. Cooking is also a way for me to connect with my home whenever I can't go back.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>When I'm not in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, you might find me at the gym, hiking, skiing, grabbing coffee with a friend, or at a festival. And like every person from the Nordics, you'll find me following the sun like a sunflower.</p>
